	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">useclip:</font>  if not set to 0, a smoothed version of input clip to be used for segmentation and must be specified.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">sclip:</font> smoothed version of input clip.Must be specified if useclip was not set to zero
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">connect4:</font> if set 0, 8 point and if set 1, 4 point connect is used for segmentation.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">sh:</font> Sharpening
	 can be -5 to 5, but preferably 1, to be spcified for each plane or atleast for first plane.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">sm:</font> smoothening can be 0 to 10 and to be specified for each plane or at least for first plane.
	 <P>Amp function segments image on watershed principle. Smoothing is done if sm is not set to 0, restricting to boundaries within each basin.
	  Sharpening is by spiking watershed boundaries and so must use small values. As watershed is known to over segment an image, the input clip should be clean or
	  smooth. If useclip parameter is not 0, sclip a pre smoothed version of the input clip(eg: blurred with gBlur function)can be used for segmentation. This segmentation is used to process the input clip and will yeild better results.</P>
