	<BR>	the script call for F1QClean is
	 <BR><BR><font color="#993366"><h2>vcm.F1QClean(clip [, int span = 5][,int fromf = 30][,int upto = NYQUIST - 10 - span] )</h2></font><BR><BR>
	 Currently NYQUIST is defined as 512. Parameter ranges are given as per this NYQUIST value.
	 <BR><font color="#ff00ff">clip:</font> input clip RGB,  YUV or GRAY constant format. Red, Green and Blue of RGB input or Y  plane of YUV input is processed.
	 <BR><font color="#ff00ff">span:</font>checks along this frequency bandwidth to find spike for cleaning. 5 to 63
	 <BR>:: <font color="#9900ff">fromf</font> search start from this frequency.value can be from 10 + span/2 to  245 - span/2. 
	 <BR>:: <font color="#9900ff">upto</font> search ends at this frequency. value can range from fromf + span to 502 - span.

	 <P> This transforms data into frequency domain utilising  libfftw3f-3.dll ( or, FFTW3 dll, or fftw.dll) of fftw.org
	    being available in path. It should be kept in mind that most of the image frequency values are near around 0.
		Caution must be excercised in specifying fromf. This function checks for anamolous values 
		within a width of span and corrects by replacing with a median value. Small values of 3 to 15 may be prefered for span. 
		Regular noise of vertical or sub vertical orientation are removed by this function. 
		If noise is near Horizontal, Transpose function may be used before and after. 
		Check for values to be used by running F1Quiver with test = 1 prior ( and after to confirm). </P>
