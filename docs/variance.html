	<BR>The call script is :-
	<BR><BR><font color="#993366"><h2>vcm.Variance(clip,int lx,int wd,int ty,int ht [,int fn = 0][,int uv = 0][,int xgrid = 5][,int ygrid = 5])</h2></font>
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">clip:</font> input clip of constant format. Compat input not accepted.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">lx:</font> Left x coordinate of window<BR><font color="#ff00ff">wd:</font> width of window<BR><font color="#ff00ff">ty:</font> top y coordinate of window<BR><font color="#ff00ff">ht:</font> height of window
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">fn:</font> frame number in which window is located.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">uv:</font> If set 0 u and v planes of YUV format not processed.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">xgrid:</font> grid size along width. Minimum 3. Maximum should not exceed half of frame width, but be reasonably small.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff">ygrid:</font> grid size along height. Minimum 3. Maximum should not exceed half of frame height, but reasonably smaller.
	<P>From the specified representative window, the global Variance is determined. In a moving grid the local Variance is determined and 
	the center of the grid point is modified in relation to these two Variances. The algorithm ensures that local edges are not destroyed.
	Repeated use of this function cleans image and may be used for very noisy clips.
	 For RGB all 3 planes are processed.  The window should be as large as possible
	but have near uniform luma for YUV or Gray formats or uniform color and intensity  for RGB format</P>
