	<BR> The script call is:
	<BR><font color="#993366"><h2>vcm.Bokeh(clip, clipb  clip [, int grid = 16][ ,float thresh = 0.45][,int rgb = [1,1,1], int yuv = [1,1,1])</h2></font>
	<BR>
	
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff"><b>clip:</b></font> Input RGB, YUV444, and Gray except Compat and half float formats. RGB seems to give better results.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff"><b>clipb:</b></font> heavily blurred  version of input clip.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff"><b>grid:</b></font> radius of circular moving grid used to find focus. Can be 3 to 64.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff"><b>thresh:</b></font> threshold to accept as in focus. Values above are treated as in focus. Can have values from  0.0 to 1.0.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff"><b>rgb:</b></font> for rgb format input, planes to be considered for process. 1 for consider and 0 for skip.
	<BR><font color="#ff00ff"><b>yuv:</b></font> for YUV format input, planes to be considered for process. 1 for consider and 0 for skip.
	<p>
	This function detects portions of input clip which are in good focus and copies them on to the heavily blurred clip. This creates image with accentuated 'Bokeh' effect. Borders are not processed. May crop them if desired. Function F2QBokeh which works in frequency domain operates on a different princeple to determine focus/defocus areas.</p>
	<p> Threshold and grid size has some dependancy. It is necessary to experiment with FrameEval for a good outcome.A script similar to F2QBokeh usage  given <BR><a href="freqScript.html">FreqScript</a> page with suitable changes can be used to arrive at parameters.</p>
